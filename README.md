### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in our labs helped me prepare to complete this assignment, as the lectures were very thorough, interactive, and helpful. The features in my weekly assignment that I felt unprepared to complete were the search bar and the dropdown menu.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have implemented at least two stretch features and spent more time styling my website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Collaboration with my peers went well, while understanding directions did not go as well as planned. Next time, I would like to spend more time reviewing documentation and labs like my peers.
